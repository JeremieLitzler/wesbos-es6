## What does async and await really mean

Why Async? To launch an asynchronous task.

Why Await? In some case, we will need to wait for an asynchronous task to finish to continue something else.

Async and Await are built on top of Promises.
The consequence is that you need a function that is promisified to use async and await.

## Error handling

See [example](Async.Await.MINE.html)

## Waiting on multiple promises

See [example](Multiple.Promises.html)

## Promisifying callback based functions

See [example](Promisifying.Functions.html)
